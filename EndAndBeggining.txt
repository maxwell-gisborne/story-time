An ancient ledgend known as The End and the Beggining.

Long ago a civilisation covered the world. Its relics can be found even now. But it fell into evil ways and was destroyed by the dark god Hubris. Some say infact that it was not a god but a wizard who destroyed the world. He looked around and was so horrified by what he saw that he drew on all his power and cast a spell to dresroy everything and recreate it as it is now. But something went wrong, or maybe it was a deliberate curse by the dark god to punish the survivors. The relics we find suggest that the people then ate the flesh of many animals and plants and took goodness from them. This is no longer possible because of the curse of that dark god. Today only the fruit of the Feedsall susstains us.
